# 911-Calls

## Overview

This repository hosts the code and analysis for the 911 Calls Project. The project focuses on analyzing emergency call data obtained from Kaggle's [Montgomery County 911 Call Center](https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert) dataset. The dataset contains crucial information such as latitude, longitude, call descriptions, zipcodes, titles, timestamps, and more.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Import and prepare the dataset for analysis.
2. Explore and gain insights from the data.
3. Identify the top 5 zipcodes and townships with the highest 911 call volumes.
4. Determine the number of unique emergency call title codes.
5. Create a new feature, 'Reason,' by parsing call titles and identify the most common reasons for 911 calls.
6. Visualize call patterns by reason, day of the week, month, and hour.
7. Use cluster analysis to discover trends in call volumes by day and hour.
8. Share the project on GitHub for accessibility and collaboration.

## Repository Contents

- `911_Calls_Capstone_Project.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code and analysis for the project.
- `911.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `README.md`: This project documentation.
- Other supporting files and visualizations generated during the analysis.

## Analysis and Findings

The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data visualization using libraries like Seaborn, and the creation of insightful plots and heatmaps. Key findings include the top zipcodes and townships for 911 calls, the most common reasons for calls, and patterns in call volumes by day and hour.

## Usage

To explore the analysis, open the `911 Calls.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. The notebook contains code cells with explanations and visualizations.

## Conclusion

The 911 Calls Project provides valuable insights into emergency call data. It showcases the use of Python data analysis libraries and visualization techniques to uncover patterns and trends in real-world data.
